# Hand-Tracking-with-Distance-Detection-and-Sound-Feedback-MediaPipe-OpenCV-Pygame-
This Python project uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to track a hand in real time via webcam and calculate the distance between the thumb tip and index fingertip. When the two fingers touch or come close together a sound is played using Pygame.
